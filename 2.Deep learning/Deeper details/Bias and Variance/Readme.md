# Bias:

Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. A model with high bias tends to oversimplify the problem and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This results in poor performance on both the training and test data.

High bias can lead to underfitting, where the model is unable to learn the relevant features and relationships in the data.
Examples of high bias models include linear regression for non-linear problems, and simple decision trees for complex datasets.

Variance:

Variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to the specific training data used.
A model with high variance is very sensitive to the training data and tends to overfit, performing well on the training data but poorly on unseen test data.
High variance models capture too many details and noise in the training data, and fail to generalize well to new, unseen examples.
Examples of high variance models include complex models like deep neural networks, decision trees with many layers, and k-nearest neighbors with a small k.
The bias-variance tradeoff:

There is a fundamental tradeoff between bias and variance in machine learning.
Simpler models tend to have higher bias and lower variance, while more complex models have lower bias but higher variance.
The goal in machine learning is to find the right balance between bias and variance to achieve good generalization performance.
This is typically done by tuning the model complexity, regularization techniques, and the amount of training data.
Underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance) are both undesirable, and the aim is to find the sweet spot that minimizes the overall error.
Techniques to address bias and variance:

To reduce bias, one can use more expressive models, increase model complexity, or add more relevant features to the input.
To reduce variance, techniques like regularization (L1, L2, dropout, etc.), ensemble methods (bagging, boosting), and cross-validation can be used.
The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning and understanding it is crucial for building effective models.
