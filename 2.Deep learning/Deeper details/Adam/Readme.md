The Adam optimizer, short for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a widely used optimization algorithm in deep learning that combines the advantages of two other popular methodsâ€”adaptive learning rates(RMSprop) and momentum with corrections.

In Adam, bias correction is applied to both the first moment (momentum) and the second moment (RMSprop) estimates to counteract their initial bias towards zero.

### First Moment (Momentum) Correction
- **Objective:** Correct the biased estimate of the mean of gradients.
- **Equation:**
  m_hat = m / (1 - decay_rate_for_momentum)
- **Explanation:**
  - m is the biased estimate of the mean.
  - m_hat is non biased
This adjusts for the fact that initially, the moving average m is smaller because it hasn't accumulated enough gradients.

### Second Moment (Variance) Correction
- **Objective:** Correct the biased estimate of the variance of gradients.
- **Equation:**
  v_hat = v / (1 - decay_rate_for_RMSprop)
- **Explanation:**
  - v is the biased estimate of the variance.
  - v_hat is non biased
  - The correction factor v / (1 - decay_rate_for_RMSprop) compensates for the initial low values of v due to the same reason as above.

### Importance
- **Accurate Scaling:** Ensures that the estimates accurately reflect the true mean and variance from the start.
- **Prevents Slow Start:** Without correction, the optimizer might make overly cautious updates initially, slowing down learning.
- **Enhances Convergence:** Leads to more reliable gradient updates, improving convergence speed and stability.

By applying these corrections, Adam maintains effective learning rates and updates even in the early stages of training.
