# Motivation
Neural networks are powerful machine learning models that can learn complex patterns in data. However, as the model complexity increases, the risk of overfitting also rises. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and idiosyncrasies, and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data.

Regularization is a technique used to address the problem of overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize. The primary goal of regularization is to introduce a bias in the model towards simpler, more generalizable solutions, without significantly compromising the model's performance on the training data.

## Specific implementations
L1 and L2 Regularization (Weight Decay): 

L1 and L2 regularization are the most common forms of regularization in neural networks. They introduce a penalty term in the loss function that encourages the model to have smaller weights, effectively reducing the complexity of the model.

### L1 Regularization (Lasso Regularization):
- L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, introduces a penalty term in the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model weights.

The loss function with L1 regularization can be written as:

    L_regularized = L_original + λ * Σ|w_i|

where
- L_original is the original loss function,
- w_i represents the individual weights in the model
- λ is the regularization strength (a hyperparameter that controls how much of an effect the penalty has).

The effect of L1 regularization is to encourage sparsity in the model weights, meaning that some weights will be driven to exactly zero. This can lead to a more compact and interpretable model, as it effectively performs feature selection by identifying the most important features.

### L2 Regularization (Ridge Regularization):
L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, introduces a penalty term in the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model weights.

The loss function with L2 regularization can be written as:

    L_regularized = L_original + λ * Σ(w_i)^2

where
- L_original is the original loss function
- w_i represents the individual weights in the model
- λ is the regularization strength

The effect of L2 regularization is to encourage smaller, more evenly distributed weights in the model. This can help to prevent overfitting by discouraging the model from relying too heavily on any single feature.

L2 regularization is often more effective than L1 regularization when the input features are highly correlated, as it can help to distribute the model's attention more evenly across the features.

The key differences between L1 and L2 regularization are:
- Sparsity: L1 regularization tends to produce sparse models, meaning that some weights are exactly zero, while L2 regularization does not produce exact zeros, but rather smaller, more evenly distributed weights.
- Feature Selection: L1 regularization can be used for feature selection, as it tends to drive some weights to zero, effectively removing the corresponding features from the model. L2 regularization does not have this property.
- Sensitivity to Outliers: L1 regularization is more robust to outliers in the data, as the absolute value function is less sensitive to large values compared to the squared function used in L2 regularization.

The choice between L1 and L2 regularization (or a combination of both) depends on the specific problem, the characteristics of the data, and the desired properties of the model. In practice, it is often beneficial to experiment with both techniques and evaluate their performance on the validation or test set to determine the most appropriate regularization strategy for the problem at hand.
