Both methods can be used to find the best values for the hyperparameters

1. **Caviar Processing (Parallel Processing):**
   - Caviar processing is a strategy that involves parallel processing, where multiple tasks or computations are executed concurrently.
   - This approach is often inspired by the way caviar, the eggs of sturgeon fish, develop. Caviar eggs hatch simultaneously, with each egg developing independently and in parallel.
   - Caviar processing aims to leverage parallel processing to train multiple different model on the same data but using different values of hyperparameters to find the best combinations

2. **Panda Processing (Sequential, Attentive Approach):**
   - Panda processing, on the other hand, refers to a more sequential, attentive approach to changing the hyperparameters even as it trains
   - This approach is inspired by the behavior of pandas, which are known for their focused way of raising a cub
   - This approach may be beneficial in scenarios where precise control of the hyperparameters is needed or there is a larage amount of data and parallel computation of multiple models are too expansive

The choice between Caviar and Panda processing strategies often depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand, such as the hardware avaliable and the size of the data.
