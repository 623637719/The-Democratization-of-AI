### [The Surprisingly Long History of Machine Learning](https://github.com/623637719/The-Democratization-of-AI/tree/main/2.Deep%20learning/History%20of%20Machine%20Learning)

## What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks, which mimics how neurones in the brain work, with many layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. These models require large amounts of data and significant computational power, often utilizing GPUs and TPUs for training due to the stupendous amount of calculating that has to go through it.
