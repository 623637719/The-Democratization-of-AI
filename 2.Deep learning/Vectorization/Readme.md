# What is Vectorization?

Vectorization is a programming technique that aims to improve the performance of code by replacing slow, iterative operations like for loops with more efficient, parallel operations. The core idea behind vectorization is to leverage the power of modern hardware, particularly GPUs, which are designed to perform multiple operations simultaneously.

At its heart, vectorization involves transforming your code to operate on entire arrays or vectors of data, rather than individual elements. This allows the hardware to process multiple data points in parallel, dramatically speeding up the execution of your code.

Example:

Scalar (non-vectorized) approach:

    for x in data:
        result.append(x * 2)

Vectorized approach:

    result = data * 2

In the scalar approach, we iterate over each element in the data list and perform the multiplication individually. In the vectorized approach, we simply multiply the entire data array by 2, and the result is a new array with each element doubled.

The benefits of vectorization become even more apparent when dealing with large datasets or computationally-intensive operations. By avoiding the overhead of a for loop, vectorized code can achieve significant performance improvements, often by an order of magnitude or more.
