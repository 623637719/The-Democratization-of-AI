# What is Reinforced Learning?
Reinforced learning(which is a subset of Machine learning) involves an agent that learns to interact with an environment by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal of reinforcement learning is to train an agent to maximize its cumulative rewards over time by trial-and-error exploration and exploitation to learn optimal policies. 

For example, a mouse exploring a dangerous maze and after countless trials and errors like being electrified and killed(and respawning) finds the most efficient way to get the cheese without setting off the electric traps. It is ok if you donâ€™t understand what this is talking about, just read on. *It is important to distinguish deep learning and reinforced learning, while deep learning is to represent complex patterns and relationships in data, reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning that deals with decision-making and probabilities
