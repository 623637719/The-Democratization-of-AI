# The Fundamental of Reinforced Learning

### Expected learnings:

1. Understanding the concepts of reinforcement learning, including agents, environments, states, actions, observations, rewards, and policies.
2. Learning about the three stages of Markov processes and how the final process connects with reinforced learning
3. Grasping the concept of states, state transitions, and transition probabilities in Markov processes.
4. Understanding the role of rewards in Markov Reward Processes and how to calculate state values and returns.
5. Learning about the discount factor (gamma) and its impact on calculating returns and state values.
6. Understanding the addition of actions in Markov Decision Processes and the concept of action spaces.
7. Learning about policies and their role in governing an agent's behaviour.
8. Visualising and interpreting transition matrices, state transition graphs, and the 3D transition matrix for Markov Decision Processes.
9. Understanding the relationship between policies, actions, and rewards in Markov Decision Processes, and how they contribute to finding optimal behaviour and maximising returns.
